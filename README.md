To do:

1 Voting mechanism
- Only one vote per user per prof/module

2 Database
- Persistent so after termination of the instance the data is still available

3 Registration of new users
- Signup via FHNW mail account

4 CRUD operations
- Fixes: its not possible to delete a module or a professor for some reason even if they are not assigned any votes

5 Secure operations
- Students are only allowed to vote, admin is allowed to change things
