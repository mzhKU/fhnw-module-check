Project idea short description: FHNW Module Rating Platform

As is known, modules at the FHNW vary in quality. The website lists modules available
at the FHNW and students can up/downvote them. To do so, they need to register with
a valid FHNW email address.

Other comments: 
There would be a lot to do and I really hope to find time for it:
- the most important thing that you can only vote once
- rate modules by documents, assignments, time requirements
- ratings should be by semester
- commenting and discussion of modules

I'm particular proud of:
- it has security
- the teaching domain combining the module and the professor domain
